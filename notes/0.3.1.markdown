Highlights:
--------------------
- Expose codahale metrics by rest service
- New dashboard with dynamic DAG (reflect latency, throughput on DAG)
- Fix several big issues in AppMaster and Executor failover. (AppMaster failed to recover and executor restart infinitely when executor crash)
- Add an example job to distribute and provision a service in the gearpump cluster.
- More complete rest service
